Firstly, sorry that the bug occurred! I'm squashing them as fast as I can find them.

## What to submit
* **If at all possible, please copy and paste the error message that was thrown into your issue submission, as that helps me track down issues immensely.**
* Please provide a description of what was happening immediately prior to the bug occuring with as much detail as possible. Things like:
  * what wand you were using,
  * any spellboosts you had attached,
  * what enemy you were fighting (if any),
  * the level the bug occurred on,
  * any inputs that you were pressing (for instance, if the bug happened as you tried to dash or something like that).

Anything you might imagine could be useful probably will be, so include it all!
